Theopenem is an on-premises solution, all servers and data remain within your organization. In terms of features and capabilities, it resembles products such as SCCM, PDQ, Desktop Central, KACE, and the list goes on. For a full list of features, check out https://theopenem.com/features . How It Works \u00b6 Like many software applications, Theopenem consists of a Server side application and a Client side application. The Server side application (\"Toems\") was developed using C# and the .NET framework. This enables easy installation on Windows Servers with IIS. Toems consists of three separate Web Applications that scale to meet the needs of any size organization. By separating the Server components into 3 Web Applications, this provides maximum flexibility and security by only exposing the required components to the correct people or endpoints. The Client agent application (\"Toec\") is a Windows Service that is installed on each endpoint you wish to manage. The agent is available in both 32 and 64 bit MSI format to enable simple deployment using GPO, cmd line install, or any other deployment application that supports MSI's. The use of an endpoint agent, gives the greatest amount of control and reporting over the endpoints without the need to enable SMB shares or ADMIN shares. All communication b/w the client and server use the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. After Theopenem Servers and Endpoints are installed and configured, they will check-in with the Server on a predefined customizable schedule (60 minutes by default). Upon check-in, the server will return any policies that are applicable to the Endpoint at that moment. The client will run the policies and then check-in with the server in another 60 minutes to see if any new policies have been added. Therefore an endpoint is constantly looking for policies to run on an interval schedule defined by the server. If a policy needs to run immediately, A Theopenem administrator can force the endpoints to check-in at any time, instead of waiting for the next check-in interval to elapse. Server Requirements (Toems) \u00b6 Hardware \u00b6 CPU requirements align with the requirements of the OS Solid State Disks are recommended by not required, storage capacity should align with the OS requirements plus enough to store the applications and images that will be deployed. Memory is the most difficult requirement to assess. It depends on many factors, such as how many Servers will be used to distribute the load, if the database is local or remote, the amount of endpoints within the organization, and the number of policies defined in Theopenem. 8GB is typically enough with 16GB (possibly more) of memory being the recommended number. Software \u00b6 The following operating systems are supported: Windows 10 Pro - See below for limitation Server 2012R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows 10 only supports 20 concurrent TCP/IP connections. It is not recommened to use Windows 10 for medium / large organizations. Note Toems requires a 64-bit Windows Server OS with .NET Framework 4.6 or newer installed. Database Requirements \u00b6 Theopenem supports the following databases: MariaDB 10.2 or greater MySQL 5.7 or greater Microsoft SQL Server 2012 or greater If you have an existing database cluster with any of the above mentioned applications, you can use it. Otherwise, you can create a new server, either on your Application Server or a separate server. The database server should have a minimum of 8 GB ram. SQL Express is not supported. Client Requirements (Toec) \u00b6 Supported OS's include: Windows 7 Windows 8/8.1 Windows 10 Toec can be installed on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Like Toems, it also requires .NET framework 4.6 or newer be installed on the OS. There are no specific CPU, Hard Drive, or Memory requirements. Client Imaging Requirements \u00b6 When deploying / uploading computer images. The following OS's can be captured / deployed. Windows XP Windows Vista Windows 7 Windows 8/8.1 Windows 10 Various Linux Distros Bandwidth Requirements / Network Impact \u00b6 Determining the impact on your network also varies depending on your individual Theopenem setup. Factors such as the number of endpoints, how often the endpoints check-in, the number of Servers, and the number of polices and modules defined in Theopenem all contribute to the impact on the network. The following example demonstrates the data utilized from a single endpoint. A new endpoint registers with Theopenem, all required certificates are exchanged and an encryption key is exchanged b/w server and endpoint. The total data sent from the client to the server and back to the client is approximately 14KB. An hour later the endpoint checks-in and has found 3 active policies. The policies are set to run an inventory scan, start tracking user logins, and start tracking application usage. The total data transferred is approximately 70KB, this number will vary depending on the size of the inventory scan. An hour later the endpoint checks-in again and no active policies are found. This time only approximately 5KB are transferred. This means that registering a new endpoint and scanning it's inventory only uses about 100KB, and 5KB every hour after that, assuming no more policies need to run. To put this in perspective, a single visit to Google with no caching, at the time of this writing was approximately 400KB. To summarize, the amount of data transferred by Theopenem on an hourly bases, is typically less than a user loading a single web page. However, this changes significantly if a policy is deploying a software application. When deploying software, the full size of the application will be transferred, this could be in the hundreds of MB or even GB. To mitigate network problems with large software deployments and a large number of endpoints, Theopenem has built-in throttling. Each Theopenem server can have a maximum number of connections as well as a maximum bitrate per connection. Each server can have different values providing flexibility depending on the power of that specific server. As a final example, A Theopenem server could set a maximum of 20 connections at 5Mb per connection, limiting the network performance of that server to 100Mbps. Endpoint Impact \u00b6 The Toec service continuously runs in the background on the endpoint. While idle, it typically uses b/w 30MB and 50MB of RAM. It will increase depending on actions needed by the policy and will eventually stabilize back to around 30MB and 50MB. An additional application named Toec-UI will also run for each user at login. This is required to run policies at user login or send messages to the endpoints. This application typically uses around 10MB of RAM. AntiVirus \u00b6 It may be necessary to whitelist the installer MSI for the Toec agent or even the directory for Toec after it's installed. Toec is installed in c:\\program files\\toec. If Toec is not functioning properly, be sure your antivirus solution isn't blocking anything. Security \u00b6 Theopenem was designed with security in mind. While no product is invulnerable to attackers, it was designed using various implementations of industry standards such as OAuth 2.0, HMAC authentication, Certificate authentication and encryption. The Server is comprised of 3 separate Web Applications allowing you control over which components should be accessible to what users. For example, the management of Theopenem is contained within the Toems-UI and Toems-API. These two applications can be firewalled off to only users that need access to the system. The endpoints only ever need to communicate with the Toec-API. Authentication to the Toems-API is achieved through OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens which are only valid for 1 hour, in addition, users are locked out for 15 minutes after too many failed login attempts, mitigating brute force attacks. The body of all communications b/w the client and server are encrypted using a combination of device certificates and encryption keys. If SSL is setup on the Web Servers, the headers will also be encrypted, as well as the body for a second time. Commands from the server to each endpoint are signed using a CA-Intermediate-Device Certificate chain ensuring the client will only run commands originating from your servers.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Welcome to The Open Endpoint Manager, a solution that provides a full suite of Windows management capabilities as well as computer imaging, computer inventory, custom asset management, and reporting.

Advanced Installation Arguments \u00b6 There are a few extra arguments that can be passed in during the installation of Toec, or embedded into the MST file. Reinstalling the MSI with any of these options will also overwrite the current value without changing anything that is not specified. LOG_LEVEL \u2013 The default logging level of Toec is INFO . To get more information, DEBUG can used. T o get less information, ERROR can be used. REMOTE_API_PORT \u2013 Specifies the port that Toec will listen on for push requests from Toems. The default value is 3913 . Push requests are not required for Theopenem to function, but it does provide the following capabilities from the computer actions menu, Current Users and Status. Previously this port was used for all push communications, but now with the move to web sockets, only the previously mentioned commands use it. Eventually it will be removed completely and solely rely on web sockets. LOCAL_API_PORT \u2013 Toec also listens on port 1415 by default for local requests only. The Toec-UI application for user logins cannot talk directly to Toems, it instead uses the Toec Service on port 1415 as an intermediary for this. USER_PORT_RANGE \u2013 The Toec-UI application loads at startup for each user that logs into the endpoint. Each Toec-UI will receive a corresponding port to communicate with that instance. The default range is 9000-10000 . REMOTE_ADDRESSES \u2013 When Toec is installed, it automatically creates a firewall exception for port 3913 to allow inbound requests. By default this exception is allowed for any ip address. If you want to limit the IP\u2019s that the exception is for, they can be specified in a comma separated list here. Such as 192.168.1.10,192.168.1.11. Be careful with this setting, if you input the wrong ip\u2019s, your Toems IP changes, or you add an additional Toems Server, you may not be able to communicate with your endpoints until you update the exception. SKIP_FIREWALL \u2013 When Toec is installed, it automatically creates a firewall exception for port 3913 to allow inbound requests. If this argument is set to true, the exception will not be created. RESET_DB \u2013 Used when reinstalling Toec. By default, the existing database is still used when Toec is reinstalled. Setting this value to true will clear the client database, treating the installation as if it were new. This would cause the endpoint to provision again. 2. Command Line Options \u00b6 After Toec is installed, it can also be run from the command line to change options or help in debugging. When using any of these commands, they must be run from an elevated cmd prompt and the service should be stopped. Toec.exe is located in c:\\program files\\toec. The commands are case sensitive . Toec.exe --console Starts Toec is console mode, displaying helpful debug info in the window.

This would cause the endpoint to provision again. If you are having trouble with the endpoint, try the partial before the full reset. A full reset may result in the loss of an existing relationship b/w the client and server. Toec.exe --resetPartial This performs a partial reset on Toec. History and installationId are not removed, everything else is reset. This will also cause the endpoint to provision again. Toec.exe --resetKey [SERVER_KEY] [CA_THUMBPRINT] Changes the server key and ca thumbprint for the endpoint. Toec.exe --prepareImage [SERVER_KEY] [CA_THUMBPRINT] If you want to install Toec before capturing an image of the computer. You must run this prior to the last shutdown of the computer.

This includes the exchange of certificates and encryption keys b/w the client and server. This process is automated when the Toec Agent is installed, but there are some settings on the Server that should be addressed to ensure a smooth provisioning process. 1. Active Directory Sync \u00b6 Syncing with Active Directory is highly recommended but not required. It is a read only one way sync from AD to Theopenem. It will sync in Computer names and Organizational Unit names, servers are skipped. The benefit of syncing in the Computers is to pre-provision them. A pre-provisioned computer is added to Theopenem but cannot yet be managed until provisioning from the client completes. When a computer is pre-provisioned, it can be assigned to groups with policies already defined, this way when an endpoint completes the provisioning process, it will automatically start running the necessary policies. Syncing from AD also allows you to assign policies to your existing OU's, as another method of targeting groups of computers. If you skipped over the LDAP setup during the server installation it's recommended to configure it now.

They are currently all on by default, but you may disable them. The following options are available in Admin Settings->Security. Preprovision Required \u2013 When this option is enabled, a computer will not be allowed to provision unless it has already been pre-provisioned. If you are syncing from Active Directory, computers have already met this requirement when they were synced. If you are not syncing from AD, pre-provisions may be manually added from Computers->Create Pre-Provision. New Computer Provision Approval Required \u2013 When this option is enabled, a Theopenem user must manually approve computers before they will be allowed to provision. This setting does not apply to pre-provisioned computers since they have already been approved. Provision approval requests will be displayed in Computers->Approval Requests when a new computer tries to provision for the first time. This is where the user can approve or deny the request. A report is emailed twice per day when endpoints are waiting for approval. Preprovision Approval Required \u2013 This setting is a combination of the previous two settings.

These components include the Toems-UI , the Toems-API , the Toec-API , and database . The installation of the endpoint agent (Toec) will be covered in the Client Installation Tutorial. If you have not yet read the Welcome Introduction , please read it before continuing. The installation process is mostly automated with the MSI. The entire process should take about 20 minutes for you to complete. Prerequisites \u00b6 Install .NET 4.6 (Only required if your server version is Server 2012R2. Newer server versions already have a greater version of .NET installed) . .NET 4.6.2 can be downloaded here . If you wish to install a newer version of .NET greater than 4.6, that is fine also. Assign your server a static ip address Topology \u00b6 Theopenem is a fully redundant and scalable application. Basic users can simply install everything on a single server. If you are more advanced or want more control over your system, you could do something like the example below. There is no limit to the number of servers you can use. Application Server 1 - This application server runs all 3 required web applications. Application Server 2 - This application server runs all 3 required web applications. Database Server - Runs the backend database that both the Toems-API and Toec-API communicate with. File Share - When more than one Toec-API or Toems-API server is installed, data replication must occur b/w the servers. An SMB file share is used for this purpose. The Toec agent does not communicate with this server. You can use any existing File Server for this purpose. If only a single Toec-API and Toems-API are used in your topology, the File Share is not needed. DMZ Toec-API (Optional) - A Toec-API server can be setup in your DMZ to allow management of endpoints when they are offsite. This server should only run the Toec-API, you should never allow Toems-API or Toems-UI access from the outside. Each application server should be dedicated to Theopenem and not shared with other web applications or services. The database server and file share can be on shared resources. The Toec-API should never go through a load balancer. Load balancing and failover of the Toec-API is built into the Toec agent.

By this point you should have at least 1 or 2 endpoints provisioned with Theopenem. These can be seen from the Toems-UI from the Computers->Search Active page. If you don\u2019t see anything listed there yet, double check the Computers->Approval Request page to make sure nothing is waiting for approval. 1. Create A Dynamic Group \u00b6 There a typically a few policies that you would want to run on all computers. These policies may include inventory tracking, user login tracking, and application usage tracking. A dynamic group is a group that is always changing the group members based on criteria that is defined. This first dynamic group will include all computers. Login to the Toems-UI Select Groups->New Provide a name such as All Computers Set the Group Type to Dynamic Provide a nice description . Leave all other options to their defaults Click Actions , then Add Group Select Dynamic Criteria from the Sub Navigation Menu Change Table to Computer , the Field to computer_name , the Operator to like , and the Value to % , click Add Click Actions , then Test Query . Should should see the list of all known computers. Click Actions , then Save Dynamic Criteria Your first group is complete. By default, Dynamic Groups update themselves every 3 hours. Saving the Dynamic Criteria again will also trigger the update. 2. Create An Inventory Policy \u00b6 Select Policies->New In the Name field, enter Collect Inventory In the Description field, enter Collect inventory on a weekly basis . Change the Frequency to OncePerWeek . Scroll down to Collect Inventory , change the drop down to Before Scroll down to Skip Server Logging Result , enable it. We don\u2019t really want a long history of inventory scans running every week clouding our logs. Click Actions , then Add Policy 3. Create A Tracking Policy \u00b6 Select Policies->New In the Name field, enter Track Users and Applications In the Description field, enter Starts the user login and application tracker each time the computer starts . Change the Trigger to Startup Leave the Frequency at Ongoing Scroll down, Enable Login Tracker and Application Monitor Skip the Server Logging Result once again. Click Actions , then Add Policy . 4. Apply The Policies \u00b6 In order for a Policy to take effect, it needs to be enabled and assigned to a group. Select Policies->Search Click Activate on each of the 2 policies listed Select Groups->Search Click View on the All Computers Group Click Available Policies from the Sub Nav Menu . Check the box for each of the Policies we just created. Click Actions , Add Selected Policies . That completes the inventory policies. Every computer that provisions with Theopenem will now do a weekly inventory scan as well as monitor application usage and user logins. The inventory scan will run at the next check-in for you provisioned endpoints which is every 60 minutes by default. The tracking policy only runs at startup, you will need to either reboot those endpoints or restart the Toec service to test it. 5. Deploy A Software Application In MSI Format \u00b6 For this example, we will create a new static group, targeting specific computers and then deploy 7-Zip. Select Groups->New Give the group a name such as Software Deployment Test Group Leave the Group Type as Static . Click Actions , Add Group Select Add Group Members from the Sub Nav Menu . Check the box next to each computer to add to the group. Click Actions , Add Selected Computers . Select Modules from the Navigation Menu . Select Software Modules , Then New Enter 7-Zip 18.06 for the Name Click Actions , Add Module Select Upload Files from the Sub Nav Menu Download 7-Zip from this link Drop the downloaded MSI into the Drop Files Here box , Click Upload Select Policies->New from the Navigation Menu Give the policy a name such as Install 7-Zip Change the Frequency to OncePerComputer Click Actions , Add Policy Select Available Modules from the Sub Nav Menu Check the box for 7-Zip 18.06 , Click Actions , Add Selected To Policy Click Actions then, Activate Policy Assign the Policy to the Software Deployment Test Group The next time any of the computers in that group startup or check-in, 7-Zip will automatically be installed. 6. Deploy A Software Application In Exe Format \u00b6 An exe can be deployed as long as it support silent options. This last example will silently deploy Firefox. We\u2019ll use a dynamic group to find computers that do not have firefox installed. Finally we\u2019ll introduce a new concept called external downloads. Select Groups-> New From the Navigation Menu For the name , enter Computers Missing Firefox Change the Group Type to Dynamic Click Actions , Add Group Select Dynamic Criteria from the Sub Nav Menu Change the And/Or dropdown to Not , the Table to Application , the Field to name , the Operator to like , and the Value to %firefox% ,click Add Click Actions , Save Dynamic Criteria Select Modules->Command Modules->New from the Navigation menu . For the name enter, Firefox 64.0.2 Click Actions , Add Module Select External Files from the Sub Nav menu Fill in a File Name , such as Firefox.exe , it can be any name you like, it\u2019s just a name for the downloaded file. Fill in the URL with https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/64.0.2/win64/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2064.0.2.exe Click Add , Click Actions , Download Files Click General from the Sub Navigation Menu Enter firefox.exe in the Command Field Enter -ms in the Arguments Field Click Actions , Update Module Assign the module to a new Policy and assign that Policy to a Group With this Policy, anytime a computer is found without Firefox, it will automatically be deployed to that computer.","title":"First Policy Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorials/first-policy/#creating-your-first-policy","text":"This last section is not required, but will provide you with a brief introduction on how to run some policies on your endpoints.
