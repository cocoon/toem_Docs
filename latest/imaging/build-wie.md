# Build the Windows Imaging Environment

Unlike the Linux Imaging Environment, the WinPE imaging environment is not distributed with Theopenem due to licensing reasons. You will need to build it yourself. 
Theopenem provides an automated tool to do this for you. The WinPE Imaging Environment must be created on a Windows 10/11 computer. Only WinPE 10 and newer will be supported.  However, the WinPE Imaging Environment supports imaging client 
computers with Win7, Win8, Win10, or Win11.

* Begin by installing the [Windows ADK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit).  On that page click the link that says **Download the Windows ADK for Windows 11, version xxxx**

* During installation, select all default options until you reach the **Features Page**.  On the features page select ***Deployment Tools***, uncheck everything else.

* Once again navigate to the [Windows ADK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit).  This time click the link that says **Download the Windows PE add-on for the Windows ADK, version xxxx**

* Install the Windows PE add-on will all the default options

* Download and extract the **WIE Builder 2.0.2** from [Theopenem downloads](https://theopenem.com/downloads)

* Login to the Toems-UI and select **Admin Settings->Client Com Servers**.  Copy the URL for the com server this WIE will connect to.

?>The WIE must be able to contact the Com Server that you choose during it's boot process.  It may choose a different com server to image from if you have more than 1 com server in your cluster.  If you want the WIE to only connect to this server, you will
need to create a cluster with only a single com server in it.

* In the package that was unzipped, **right click** on **ToemsPE-Build.cmd** and select **edit**

* Paste in the com server URL where it says **ComServerURL=**.  Overwriting the http://0.0.0.0/ with your com server url.

* Save and close the file.

* Right click on **ToemsPE-Build.cmd** and select **Run as Administrator**

* After the the script is done(It may take up to 10 minutes), look in the builds directory for the output.

* If you are PXE booting, merge the tftp folder with your Theopenem Tftp Folder located at **c:\program files\theopenem\tftpboot**.  You must do this on every com server. Change your PXE Mode in **Admin Settings->PXE / Boot Menu->PXE Settings** 
to the appropriate WinPE architecture. WinPE also works with the Toems Proxy DHCP to support both Legacy BIOS and EFI PXE booting simultaneously. 

* If you are using a USB / ISO, there are 3 iso files. A 32 and 64 bit ISO, that both work on Legacy BIOS and EFI systems, and a Super ISO. The Super ISO works on all 32 and 64 bit Legacy BIOS, and EFI systems with a single ISO. 
You can use something like Rufus to copy these ISOâ€™s to USB.
