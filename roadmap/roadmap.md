**Theopenem 1.5.6 (December 2023)**
* Add WinGet management to Toec.  This has some great potential for easily distributing and updating apps.

**Theopenem 1.5.7 (May 2024)**
* Add ability for each com server to utilize an SMB share.  This will provide the ability to use SMB Imaging with multiple com servers, instead of a centralized share.
* Find a way to replicate storage among com servers, without the need for an SMB share.

**Theopenem 2.0.0 (TBD??)**
* New WebUI - Most likely Blazor
* Migration to .NET 7.0? - This depends on the eol date for .NET versions prior to .NET Core.  If Windows server continues support for older .NET versions, this migration will not be done.  As of today (6-8-2023) there is no EOL date for .NET 4.8.
