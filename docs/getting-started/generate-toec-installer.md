# Generate Toec Installer
The last component that is needed to manage your endpoints, is the client agent, or Toec.  It must be installed on each endpoint you want to manage, but first we need to create it.

###### 1. Create MSI
* Login to the Toems web interface
* Select Admin Settings from the Navigation menu
* Select Toec from the Sub Navigation menu
* Click the Actions button
* Select Export Client Msi 64-bit
* When prompted, save the file somewhere
* Click the Actions button
* Select Export Client Msi 32-bit
* When prompted, save the file somewhere

---

You now have the Toec installers for both 32 and 64 bit OS's.  These installers are specific to your environment.  They have your certificates, com servers, and provision keys embedded into them.
