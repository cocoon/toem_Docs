# Test Toec-API
Now is a good time to test the Toec-API to see if the com server and web.config file are correct.

###### 1.  Test Toec-API (Client connections)
* Open a web browser
* Navigate to http://server-ip:8888/Provision/VerifyDb replacing server-ip with your actual ip.  Ex: **http://192.168.56.100:8888/Provision/VerifyDb**
* The page should respond with the number 60
* If this step was successful the Toec-API is running and can access the database
