# Test The Web Applications
Now is a good time to test the 3 web applications before continuing on.  These tests are all done through your web browser, and should be done from a 
remote computer to test the firewall rules as well.  Your Theopenem server should now be reachable by the serverâ€™s FQDN and corresponding port.  

!!! info "In these examples the server name is toems-01.theopenem.com and should be replaced by your actual server name."

###### 1.  Test Toems-API (Backend)
* Open a web browser
* Navigate to http://toems-01.theopenem.com:8080/Setting/VerifyDb
* The page should respond with the number 60
* If this step was successful the Toems-API is running and can access the database

###### 2.  Test Toec-API (Client connections)
* Open a web browser
* Navigate to http://toems-01.theopenem.com:8888/Provision/VerifyDb
* The page should respond with the number 60
* If this step was successful the Toec-API is running and can access the database

###### 3.  Test Toems-UI (Frontend)
* Open a web browser
* Navigate to http://toems-01.theopenem.com
* You should be greeted by the login page
* Login With:
> **Username:** toemsadmin  
> **Password:** toemsadmin
* If this step was successful the Toems-UI is running and can communicate with Toems-API.  **Do not attempt to configure anything in the Toems-UI yet.**  Close your browser.
