# Create Scheduled Task

!!! info "This section is only performed on the server that has the Toems-API Server Role set as primary.  If you remember, this role was defined in the Toems-API Web.config file."

Theopenem has a series of tasks that run at various time intervals.  This list can be found in Admin Settings->Task Scheduler.  These tasks are all initiated 
from within the Toems-API web application as long as it hasnâ€™t gone to sleep.  The problem is that the Toems-API is only used when someone logs into the Toems-UI.  This 
means that the Toems-API is a very low traffic application and most of the time will be asleep preventing the Task Scheduler from running.  This section will setup a Windows Task 
to keep the Toems-API awake.

###### 1. Create A Local User To Run The Task
* Go to start or run and enter ```lusrmgr.msc```

* Create a Password for the user
* Uncheck User must change password at next logon
* Check User cannot change password
* Check Password never expires
